## Overview

Welcome to the Blackjack Python game! This simple console-based game allows you to experience the thrill of playing Blackjack against the computer. The objective is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.

## How to Play

1. At the beginning of the game, both you and the computer will be dealt two random cards.
2. Your current score and the computer's first card will be displayed.
3. You have the option to either draw another card ('y') or pass ('n').
4. If you choose to draw another card, your new card will be added to your hand, and your score will be updated.
5. If your score exceeds 21 or you decide to pass, the game will end, and the computer will take its turn.
6. The computer will automatically draw cards until its score is at least 17 or it exceeds 21.
7. After both you and the computer have finished drawing cards, the final hands and scores will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.

## Playing the Game

To play the Blackjack Python game, simply run the `main.py` file in your Python environment. You will be prompted to play a game of Blackjack, and you can continue playing as many games as you like by typing 'y' to continue or 'n' to exit.
